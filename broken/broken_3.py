# broken_3.py — Fix the TypeError
#
# Run this file: python broken/broken_3.py
# Read the traceback. Then fix the bug and run again until it exits with no errors.
#
# Hint: A TypeError means an operation was applied to a value of the wrong type.
# Hint: The `+` operator on strings does concatenation — both operands must be strings.
# Hint: To convert an integer to a string: str(value). Or use an f-string instead of +.
